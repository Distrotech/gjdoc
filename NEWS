New in release 0.7.6

* Better output for classes in the unnamed package.

* Now uses platform default encoding if -charset isn't specified.

* Fixed parsing of strings in constant field values, backslashes in
  single quotes, and inline tags at the beginning of line within
  out-of-line tags.

* Wrapper script now tested to work on bash, zsh, posh, tcsh, ksh,
  pdksh, and sash.

* Improved XHTML compatiblity of generated output; new option
  -validhtml.

* Graceful handling of empty/incomplete javadoc tags.

* Better handling of unresolvable single-class imports.

* Proper links to nested class documentation pages, removed
  superfluent nested class headers from output, added links to
  overridden methods.

* Fixed formatting of @version tags.

* Added date of generation to About page.

* Minor cleanups and performance improvements.

* Credits are now in the AUTHORS file.


New in release 0.7.5

* Option -group works now.  Previously, package patterns never
  matched.  Thanks to Wolfgang Baer for reporting this.

* System.exit() is now only called in the main() method, enabling use
  of gjdoc via reflection.  Thanks to Wolfgang Baer for reporting
  this.

* -link/-linkoffline facility works better now.  Previously, external
  types haven't always been hyperlinked properly.  Thanks to Mark
  Wielaard for reporting this.

* Unavailable external documentation sets are handled gracefully now.
  Thanks to Jack Bates for reporting this.

* Command line option keywords are now treated as case-insensitive.
  Thanks to Andrew Overholt for reporting this and to Thomas
  Fitzsimmons for insisting on this change.

* Missing whitespace after type dimension specifiers (as in
  "int[]foo;") is now accepted.  Thanks to Andrew Overholt for
  reporting this.

* If a package directory exists in more than one -sourcepath root
  directory, the contents of all package directories are now merged
  properly.  Thanks to some guy on #classpath for reporting this.

* The build is now looking for antlr.jar in /usr/share/antlr/lib.
  This is where it is located on Gentoo.  Thanks to David Gilbert for
  reporting this.

* Option -all has been revised and works now for classes in the
  default package.  Thanks to Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho for reporting
  this.

* For option -all, gjdoc now makes sure that source files are in the
  proper package with respect to the specified -sourcepath.

* Bogus "<>" empty type parameter information that was generated under
  certain circumstances is now omitted.

* Ordering of usage types on the class use pages is now deterministic.

* Removed debug message "no member found for xyz".

* Minor performance enhancements.


New in release 0.7.4

* Gjdoc now supports type variables at the class level (e.g. List<E>,
  Pair<A,B>).  Thanks to Andrew John Hughes for implementing this.

* Comma-separated field definitions and static field values involving
  brackets and braces are now parsed correctly.  Thanks to David
  Gilbert for reporting this.

* The class documentation page now lists inner classes properly.

* The wrapper script now passes options prefixed with -J to the
  virtual machine.  This is especially useful for increasing the
  maximum heap size to avoid OutOfMemoryErrors when running gjdoc on
  large trees.  Thanks to Wolfgang Baer for reporting this.

* The bytecode build now properly includes XmlDoclet classes when
  --enable-xmldoclet is specified at configure time.  Thanks to 
  Wolfgang Baer for reporting this.


New in release 0.7.3

* Fixed a critical bug in gjdoc.sh.in which would fail due to a broken
  classpath.

* gjdoc.sh.in now tries to use the VM configured using JAVA or
  installed at /usr/bin/java first and only falls back to the one used
  during build if no VM is found this way. Thanks to Jerry Haltom.


New in release 0.7.2

* Fixed a bug which omitted the last declared thrown exception in
  interface method declarations.

* Class discovery via reflection is now disabled by default to avoid
  unintended side effects during class loading. Re-enable using option
  -reflection.

* Build: jar files are now put into $(datadir)/java instead of
  $(datadir)/java/ext (so by default, jar files now end up in
  $PREFIX/share/java).

* Minor bug fixes.


New in release 0.7.1

* Man page and rudimentary Info manual

* Fixed support for -encoding, -title, -nocomment

* Now sets exit code properly on failure

* Fixes for several minor build problems, mostly related to jar file
  assembly and tool detection.

* Bytecode wrapper script now includes antlr.jar on the classpath


New in release 0.7.1-pre3

* Add option --with-antlr-jar to configure

* Look in /usr/lib for antlr.jar

* Detect gij

* Detect fastjar

* Fixed wrapper script for bytecode version

* Various other improvements to build
