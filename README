Documentation generation framework for java source files.

1. Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gjdoc provides a framework for generating documentation in various
formats from java source files.  It implements all features of the
traditional javadoc tool version 1.4 - except for one unimplemented
option (-serialwarn), it is fully command-line compatible and it
provides a compatible Doclet API (package com.sun.javadoc).

In contrast to Javadoc, `gjdoc' does not perform syntax checking on
the supplied sources. If necessary, use commands like `gcj
-fsyntax-only` or `jikes +B' for checking the sources beforehand.

The gjdoc package ships with a standard doclet for generating HTML
output (the default).

A debug doclet which just prints (not yet) all information to
System.out and which can be used to explore the doclet interface.
(enabled by -doclet gnu.classpath.tools.doclets.debugdoclet.DebugDoclet)

And a doclet that generates output in XML format, which can then be
postprocessed into other formats with xslt tools like xsltproc or the
javax.xml.transform package of GNU JAXP and/or GNU Classpath.  (Only
available when configured with --enable-xmldoclet and enabled by
-doclet gnu.classpath.tools.doclets.xmldoclet.Driver)

This tool is part of GNU Classpath-tools.
See http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/cp-tools/



2. Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generic installation instructions apply:
./configure && make && sudo make install

See INSTALL for further details.

GNU make ("gmake") is required for building gjdoc.

You will also need ANTLR 2.7.1 or better installed. See http://antlr.org/.

When working from CVS you will also need the following tools:
- GNU autoconf 2.59+
- GNU automake 1.9+
- GNU libtool 1.5+

When working from CVS you can run the above tools by executing
./autogen.sh in the source directory.

Gjdoc is known to build with GNU GCJ 4.0 and jikes 1.21. It is known
to run on GCJ 4.0, kaffe (CVS of February 5 2005) and jamvm 1.2.3.

For a couple of known build and runtime problems please see the file
TROUBLESHOOTING.
